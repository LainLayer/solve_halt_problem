#Description 

The halt problem states that we cannot prove that the program stops or run forever. That's why we do it simultaneously.
To do this, we need to find a state that we will go through exactly twice. And a new transition that has not yet happened. At the point that we have passed 2 times there is a halt point, the end point of a new transition from this point to the start point of the cycle.

So whare "halt point" halt point every where, and start of loop after it.
